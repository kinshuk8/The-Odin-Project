    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
    <p>"We have been making this for years — at every party, this is requested," says AngKN. "We use rotisserie chicken and blue cheese instead of ranch (but that's just because we dip our regular wings in blue cheese)."</p>
    <p>"I've always liked the IDEA of Buffalo wings, but not so much the cooking or eating of the actual wings," according to Lindsay Anderson. "This dip solves my problem. It's delicious and rich and I can feel like I'm eating a 'proper football game food.'"</p>
    <p>"I found this recipe on this site two years ago and have made it many, many times," says Kimberly Kotz Walls. "I always use cooked, seasoned chicken breasts and I add chopped onion and celery to give it some texture."</p>
